          <title>Class Participation</title>
          <p>
This course is designed as an active-learning course since learning mathematics involves getting your hands dirty and digging in! You will be contributing to a student-centered learning community in which each student should feel comfortable sharing ideas and learning from mistakes. With this aim, it is important that we all commit to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and professional learning environment. 
          </p>
          <p>
Learning collaboratively via carefully constructed activities will form a substantial part of the in-class experience. You will have the opportunity to present your reasoning to classmates and provide thoughtful feedback on the results of others. Asynchronous activities will include reading the text and/or watching video lectures connected to course content and completing assignments. 
          </p>
          <p>
In-class participation is a key component of the course structure. At times, interactive lecture may be included to introduce some material, as well as for clarifying and synthesizing key ideas. Credit for participation will depend on preparation for class and your demonstrated level of engagement with class activities. Persistent tardiness and early departures will affect your participation credit. I understand that extenuating circumstances may arise, so you will have two “participation tokens” that you can use to excuse absences, no questions asked. If teamwork will be affected, please contact your team, and copy me, to make arrangements for your portion of the work.

          <title>Grading for Growth/Mastery-Based Testing:</title>
          <p>
            This course will use a testing method called, 
            "Grading for Growth Exams" or "Mastery-Based Testing.'' There will be four (4) paper-and-pencil, 
            in-class Mastery Exams given periodically throughout the semester.
              In grading for growth exams, 
            students receive credit only when they "meet expectations" or display "mastery", but they receive multiple attempts to 
            do so. The primary source of extra attempts comes from the fact that exam questions appear on
             every subsequent test. In this Calculus III course, Exam 1 will have 5 questions. 
             Exam 2 will have 10 questions -a remixed version of the five from Exam 1 and five new questions.
              Exam 3 will have 15 questions- a remixed version of the ten from Exam 2 and five new questions.
               Exam 4 will have 18 questions- a remixed version of the fifteen from Exam 3 and three new questions.  We will also have four testing weeks. During these weeks, students can sign up to retest concepts during (extended) office hours or during Study Tables hours. Students are allowed to test any concept, but cannot retest that concept the rest of the week. So for example, a student can test concepts 2,3 and 5 on Monday and concept 6 on Tuesday, but would not be able to test concept 5 again. These testing weeks are tentatively scheduled and noted in our course schedule. Our final testing week is during Finals Week.
                   Students will be able to retest the new concepts from the last exam twice during 
                   the final testing week.
          </p>
        </li>

          <title>Grading of Exams </title>
             
          <p>
          The objectives of this course can be broken down into 18 main concepts/problems. 
           For each sort of problem on the exam, I identify three levels of performance: 
           meets expectations level, 
           progressing level, and novice level. I will record how well the student does on each problem 
           (an M for master/meet expectations level, a P for progressing level, a 0 for novice level) on each exam. 
           After the Final testing week, I will make a record of the highest level of performance the
            student has made on each sort of problem or project and use this record 
            to determine the 
            student's total exam grade.  Each of the first 9 concepts/questions students
             "master" will count
             8% points towards their exam grade (with the first one being worth 9%).
              After that, each concept/question will be worth 3% towards your exam grade. 
              So for example, if you meet expectations for 11 of the 18 concepts your grade will be a 79%. </p>
<p>
This particular way of arriving at the course grade is unusual.
 It has some advantages. Each of you will get several chances to meet expectations for
 almost all the problems.
  Once you have displayed mastery of a problem there is no need to do problems 
  like it on later exams.
   So it can certainly happen that if you do well on the midterms you might only have to
    do one or two problems on the Final. (A few students may not even have to take the final.) 
    On the other hand, because earlier weak performances are not averaged in, 
    students who come 
    into the Final on shaky ground can still manage to get a respectable grade for the course.
     This method of grading also stresses working out the problems in a completely correct way, 
     since accumulating a lot of progressing level performances only results 
     in a progressing level performance.
      So it pays to do one problem carefully and correctly as opposed to trying to get four problems partially
       correctly. Finally, this method of grading allows you to see easily which parts of the course you are
        doing well with, and which parts deserve more attention. The primary 
        disadvantage of this grading scheme 
        is that it is complicated. At any time, if you are uncertain about how you are doing in the class I would
         be more than glad to clarify the matter.

          <title>AI Usage Policy</title>
                  
          <p>
            This policy is motivated by the rise of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI
             assisted technologies. The policy aims to provide greater transparency and guidance to students.
              This policy applies to all aspects of student work, from research and development of models 
              (including code creation) to the written report or poster. Since these emerging technologies are 
              quickly evolving, Dr. Harsy will refine this policy as appropriate.
Students must be open and honest about all their uses of AI tools, including embedded AI 
(e.g., code- copilots and other AI assisted auto-complete technologies, etc.). The more transparent a 
student and their submissions are, the more likely it is that their work can be fully trusted, appreciated, 
and correctly used by others. These disclosures aid in understanding the development of intellectual work and 
in the proper acknowledgement of contributions. Without open and clear citations and references of the role of 
AI tools, it is more likely that questionable passages and work could be identified as plagiarism and result in 
deductions or a failed grade. Solving the problems in this class and creating posters for the class does
 not require the use of AI tools, although their responsible use is permitted. 
 Dr. Harsy recognizes the value of LLMs and generative AI as productivity tools that can help students
  in preparing their submission; to generate initial ideas for a structure, for example, or when summarizing,
   paraphrasing, language polishing etc. There are many tasks in model development where human creativity
    and teamwork is essential, and where a reliance on AI tools introduces risks. Therefore,
     we advise caution when using these technologies for tasks such as solving homework problem 
     (often AI uses incorrect methods for what is being assessed), model selection and building,
      assisting in the creation of code, interpreting data and results of models, and drawing scientific 
      conclusions.
          </p>
          <p>
It is important to note that LLMs and generative AI have limitations and are unable to
 replace human creativity and critical thinking.
 I advise students to be aware of these risks if they choose to use LLMs:
          </p>
          <p>
  <ul>
    <li><alert>Objectivity: </alert> 
      Previously published content containing racist, sexist, or other biases can arise in LLM- generated text, 
      and some important viewpoints may not be represented.
    </li>

     <li><alert>Accuracy: </alert> 
      LLMs can ‘hallucinate’ i.e. generate false content, especially when used outside of their domain or when dealing with complex or ambiguous topics. They can generate content that is linguistically but not scientifically plausible, they can get facts wrong, and they have been shown to generate citations that don’t exist. Some LLMs 
     are only trained on content published before a particular date and therefore present an incomplete picture.
    </li>
   <li> <alert> Contextual understanding: </alert> LLMs cannot apply human understanding to the context of
     a piece of text, especially when dealing with idiomatic expressions, sarcasm, humor, or metaphorical language.
      This can lead to errors or misinterpretations in the generated content.
   </li>
   <li> <alert> Training data: </alert> LLMs require a large amount of high-quality training data to 
    achieve optimal performance. In some domains or languages, however, such data may not be readily available, 
    thus limiting the usefulness of any output.
   </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p> <alert>Students are expected to: </alert>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Clearly indicate the use of LLMs or other AI tools, including embedded AI (e.g., code-copilots and 
        other AI assisted auto-complete technologies, etc.) in their report, including which model was used 
        and for what purpose. Please use inline citations and the reference section. Also include the Report 
        on Use of AI (described below) along with your project or homework submissions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Verify the accuracy, validity, and appropriateness
         of the content and any citations generated by language models and correct any 
         errors or inconsistencies.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Provide citation and references, following guidance provided here.
         Double-check citations to ensure they are accurate and are properly referenced.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Be conscious of the potential for plagiarism since LLMs may reproduce substantial text from other sources. 
        Check the original sources to be sure you are not plagiarizing someone else’s work.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
 <alert> Dr. Harsy will take appropriate action
when she identifies submissions likely prepared with undisclosed use of such tools.</alert> </p>
        </li>

    <title>Citation and Referencing Directions </title>
    <p>
      Think carefully about how to document and reference whatever tools, papers, references you may 
      choose to use. A variety of style guides are beginning to incorporate policies for the citation
       and referencing of AI tools. Use inline citations and list all AI tools used in the creation of 
       your projects and assignments. Here is an example of how cite your AI use:
      </p>
       <p>
        OpenAI ChatGPT (Nov 5, 2023 version, ChatGPT-4)
       </p>
       <p>
Query1: (insert the exact wording you input into the AI tool) 
       </p>
       <p>
Output: (insert the complete output from the AI tool)

       </p>
  </li>    
 
  <li> <title> Make-Ups Assignments </title>
    <p>
      There will be no make-ups for any assignments. If you are late or miss class, 
      your assignment will not be accepted and there will be no make-up offered, 
      except in extenuating and unpredictable circumstances. If you will miss class
       for a justifiable and unavoidable reason, you can contact me <alert>before </alert>
       you miss class and it is possible you can have a make-up. If you do not contact me,
       you will not be allowed a make-up or late assignment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> <title> Class Attendance </title>
    <p>
      Attendance is critical for success in this course and is required of all students without exception. A student absent from class is responsible for all material covered that day. I usually post solutions to ICE sheets and post notes. I will stop doing this if there is a trend of absences. In other words, I will not post lecture notes unless there is consistent attendance. Students are expected to attend all classes as part of the normal learning process.

      <title>Homework</title>
      <p>
Almost every week, I will collect a homework assignment. I will post these homework assignments on Blackboard. You may work with others on the homework, but it must be your own work. If I catch you copying homework, you will get a 0. Please see the academic honesty section below.  Sometimes the homework include a ``warm-up" assignment to

      <paragraphs>
      <title>Class Activities</title>
      <p>
Every class will include some kind of interactive activity and/or problem 
set related to the reading and video assignments. The activities will include hands-on discovery 
learning and collaborative group work. You will be solving problems from the perspective of our 
mathematical founders. This means that we often know “the solution” and we will instead emphasize
 the way mathematics was developed. Therefore, I will be pushing you to think flexibly, to provide 
 solutions using multiple representations, and to provide clear explanations of your reasoning.
  Each activity will be completed in small groups. You are expected to positively contribute to 
  discussions and to be actively engaged in the activities. This is not possible if you are frequently 
  absent, off task, or fail to contribute to your group. 
      </p>
      <p>
Your group will submit one set of responses for each activity, approximately once per week.
 You will also submit individual group evaluations which will help inform your participation grade.
To earn credit, submitted assignments should follow the posted Assigned Work Guidelines. Most activities
 will be assessed on mathematical reasoning, conceptual understanding, professional communication, explanation,
  and justification. Work that is suspected to be plagiarized will earn 0 points and may result in a
   reduced grade for the course (see Lewis' Academic Integrity Policy).

      <title>Reading Quizzes, Discussions, and Video Assignments</title>

      <p>
The history of mathematics is filled with many intriguing stories and folk tales. 
Understanding the historical and social context surrounding a particular mathematical idea helps us 
better understand the concept itself. For this reason, regular reading will be assigned from the textbook, 
and supplemental articles and videos will be posted on Blackboard.
 Reading quizzes and online discussions will assess your understanding of the main 
 ideas from texts and class activities. Quizzes, discussions, and videos will be open book/notes 
 and will be posted to Blackboard.
